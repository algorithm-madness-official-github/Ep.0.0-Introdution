I'm going to do all theese topics, but these several units at the end don't have specified their lessons. This is because I know too few to explain it to anyone. But they are at the very end of the course so I will certainly have enough time to study theese topics for myself and then make a video about this.

One small issue, I'm not going to make Discord Server for this channel, but if someone of you guys, would make it and send to me, then I will add another link in the video description of my every epizode.
